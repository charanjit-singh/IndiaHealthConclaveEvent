          <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align:left;">
            Providing quality healthcare to its citizens is the goal of every civilized society. Apart from causing physical and mental suffering of the patient,<strong> ill health is also responsible for emotional trauma to the entire family.</strong> The situation becomes more acute if the illness leads to the loss
of earnings for the patient and family. The dual problem of loss of income and high cost of
healthcare pose serious challenge to an average patient. Hence, it is desirable<strong> to provide
quality healthcare to every human being at an affordable cost. </strong>

<br>
<br>
<strong>India is the 2nd largest populated country (1.35 billion) in the World constituting 29.1% of 0-4 age group, 8.3% of 60 plus, and 65.6% of 15-64 age group covering around 790 million (as
per census 2011). </strong> For a large number of Indians today, access to quality healthcare is
inadequate, and the health system’s goal of access, affordability and quality remain elusive.
Focus on prevention and wellness is limited, reflecting a highly unorganised primary-care
system. Compounding the situation is an inadequate delivery infrastructure, talent shortage
and limited funding from public and private sources.
No doubt in last four years under the dynamic leadership of Sh. Narender Modi Ji and able
guidance of Sh. JP Nadda Ji, path-breaking measures like <strong> Ayushman Bharat Yojana or Pradhan
Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), Mission
Indradhanush, AMRIT Pharmacies, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao etc</strong> are
launched, to ensure the availability of affordable health services to each and every Indian
citizen. But the callus attitude of 69 years and a huge gap left between the need and capacity
is a huge challenge. <br><br>
<strong>Current status of health care delivery system </strong> to rural masses and urban poor <strong> cannot be
considered satisfactory.</strong> Even the targets set out by the Bhore Committee on the eve of India's
independence are nowhere close to being achieved. We have not even reached half the level
in provision of health care that most developed countries had reached between the two world
wars. Healthcare in India currently faces the unique challenges of <strong>poor access, low affordability
and high variation in quality.</strong> It is time to review the <strong> current health system, especially in light
of the experiences of other health systems,</strong> in particular those in emerging markets such as
Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico and China which recently made attempts to provide affordable
access to large populations.<br><br>
<strong>
To achieve the abovementioned objectives, multiple health system archetypes exist, each with
varying degrees of effectiveness. India must take lessons from these systems into account
but adopt an India-centric health system that is capable of powering economic development
in India. To achieve that goal, we must promote Indian think tanks in the field of health 
planning. Professionals working at grass root level can innovate out of box health care delivery
systems and solutions to existing road blocks. India must choose its evolutionary trajectory
wisely. Now is an opportune time to define India’s health system in order to empower India’s
growth and development.
To promote this concept CEPR (Centre for economic policy and research) in association with
SAHC (Society for Affordable Healthcare) is organizing a conclave i.e. INDIA HEALTH
CONCLAVE in New Delhi.<br></strong>
